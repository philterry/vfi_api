= Blocking Ordered(BO)

This is the normal blocking IO with a normal open of /dev/rddma.

In this mode the write of the command is blocking until the command
has completed. When the write completes the read will have a pending
result waiting. Thus no need to poll the read after the write. In this
mode all execution is ordered.

= Non-Blocking

If /dev/rddma is opened with the O_NONBLOCK option then the write of
the command returns immediately.

The read response is also non-blocking and will return -EAGAIN if
empty when read. The poll command can be used to block (with or
without timeout) if a blocking semantic is required, followed by the
read.

There are two methods of using this non-blocking mode:

- ordered execution
- out-of-order execution

== Non-Blocking Ordered Execution (NBO)

In this mode a non-blocking write of a command is issued only so that
further processing can be performed before waiting for the response
with the read, that is, the execution of the command can be
parallelized with other processing.

But, most importantly, before any further commands are submitted for
execution, the application must issue a successful read for the
result. In this way there are no problems with out of order
completions. Thus the execution sequence consists of an an endless
stream of interleaved write/poll/read sequences.

== Non-Blocking Out of Order(NBOO)

In this mode multiple non-blocking writes of multiple commands may be
performed without waiting for a response. As commands can complete out
of order the sequence of responses on the read queue may be out of
order with respect to the invoking write commands.

In this mode some mechanism must therefore be used to correlate the
responses to the requesting commands. Invariably with this approach
the correlation coincides with the blocking and resumption of thread execution.
